## What you'll deploy

This guide walks through deploying `blank_scenario_2_subnets` - a minimal network lab with 4 Linux VMs across 2 subnets.

### What is a "blank scenario"?

It's not really a "scenario" in the classical sense (e.g., a CTF, a SIEM lab).
It's a **clean working base**: a few empty Ubuntu VMs across isolated subnets,
ready for you to install whatever you want on top - services, workloads,
training material, attack/defense exercises.

Think of it as a **starter kit** - a working network of VMs ready in ~20 minutes,
then yours to populate with whatever services, workloads, or training material
you want on top.

vedicon ships 3 blank scenarios:
- `blank_scenario_2_subnets` - 2 subnets, 4 VMs (this guide)
- `blank_scenario_4_subnets` - 4 subnets, 16 VMs
- `blank_scenario_6_subnets` - 6 subnets, 24 VMs

For a full SIEM + CTF cyber range, see `demo_lab` instead (still a work in progress).

All scenarios live in [vedicon-vedicon_playbook/scenarios](https://github.com/vedicon/vedicon_cyber_range_platform-vedicon_playbook/tree/main/scenarios) - the list will grow over time. See [Extend the scenarios](#extend-the-scenarios) at the end of this guide for how to request new ones.

### Prerequisites for this guide

- A Proxmox VE 7.x or 8.x server you can reach
- Linux operator machine with Python 3.10+
- ~25 minutes of your time (mostly automated)

When done, you'll have:

                                               └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

You SSH into VMs via the Proxmox jump host:

```
deployer-cli  ──ssh──▶  Proxmox jump_user  ──ProxyJump──▶  bs2-team-XXX-XX
```

---

## Prerequisites

### On your local machine (operator workstation)

- Linux:
  - **Ubuntu LTS Desktop or Server (24.04)** — primary supported platform, what we develop and test on
  - **Debian 13** — also expected to work (less extensively tested)
  - Other distros may work but are not officially supported
- Python 3.10+
- `python3-bcrypt` (required to generate passphrase-protected ed25519 SSH keys ; the wizard preflight detects it and offers an Install button if missing, but you can pre-install with `sudo apt install python3-bcrypt`)
- Network access to your Proxmox (see ports below)

### On the Proxmox server

- One physical interface with internet access (e.g., `vmbr0`)
- Root SSH access enabled (the wizard will install a key automatically)
- Storage `local-lvm` available

### Network ports - operator → Proxmox

The wizard and `vedicon-context` need these open from your operator machine to the Proxmox host:

| Port | Protocol | Used for |
|------|----------|----------|
| 22 | TCP | SSH (root for bootstrap, jump_user for ProxyJump after) |
| 8006 | HTTPS | Proxmox API (VM lifecycle, network config, etc.) |


If you're behind a firewall, allow at least 22 + 8006. 


### Optional — local apt proxy

If you have a local apt cache (apt-cacher-ng, Squid, etc.), the wizard's
**step 0** lets you provide its URL. When set, vedicon plumbs the proxy through
three layers automatically:

- **deployer-cli** (`/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00vedicon-proxy`) — applied by
  `deployer.bootstrap` before any apt install
- **Proxmox host** — a cloud-init snippet is dropped at
  `/var/lib/vz/snippets/vedicon-apt-proxy.yaml` by `proxmox.init`
- **lab VMs** — the snippet is attached as cloud-init `vendor-data` on every
  VM template (`qm set <id> --cicustom vendor=...`); all clones inherit the
  proxy at first boot

Format expected: `http(s)://host:port` (e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:3142` for
apt-cacher-ng's default port). The wizard validates the format and runs a
reachability check before letting you proceed.

Leave the field empty in the wizard if you don't have a proxy — everything
works without it, just slower on apt-heavy installs.

## Walkthrough - wizard steps

For each step you'll see:
- **Screenshot** of the wizard at this step (placeholder for now)
- **What you do** - what to enter / click
- **Behind the scenes** - what the wizard does on your machine and on Proxmox

### Step 0 - Clone the main repo

You only need the `vedicon` repo locally — it contains the wizard. The wizard
itself will clone the rest (vedicon_playbook, catalog, controller, devkit) on the
deployer-cli during deploy.

```bash
sudo apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install python3-venv git
mkdir -p $HOME/vedicon && cd $HOME/vedicon
git clone https://github.com/vedicon/vedicon_cyber_range_platform_cyber_range_platform.git
```

> **Recommended:** keep the default paths (`$HOME/vedicon` for git repos,
> `$HOME/vedicon.config` for workspaces). The wizard offers to change them
> if you really need to, but the defaults are well-tested and many scripts /
> configs reference them. **This is the only structural constraint** — the
> rest of the wizard is fully configurable.

### Step 1 - Launch the wizard (preflight)

```bash
cd ~/vedicon/vedicon
./vedicon-init.py
```

![Step 1 - wizard launch](docs/img/step-01-launch.png)

**What you do:** wait for the preflight checks. If anything is missing,
the wizard offers to install it (textual, ansible, sshpass, keychain).

**Behind the scenes:**
- Checks `which ansible ssh-keygen ssh-agent sshpass git keychain zsh`
- Checks Ansible collections: `community.crypto`, `community.general`
- Checks if `inventories/example/` exists
- Checks ssh-agent is running

If anything is missing, the wizard either auto-installs (apt) or shows the
fix command for you to run manually.

### Step 1b - Confirm install paths

![Step 1b - install paths](docs/img/step-01b-install-path.png)

**What you do:** review the install paths and confirm.

The wizard asks where to put two things:
- **vedicon git repos** → default: `$HOME/vedicon/`
- **vedicon workspaces** (per-codename configs, secrets, SSH keys) → default: `$HOME/vedicon.config/`

**Recommended: keep the defaults.** Changing them is possible but it is one of
the **rare elements we recommend not to modify** — many internal scripts,
templates and helper functions reference these paths, and a non-default layout
can make troubleshooting harder.

**Behind the scenes:**
- The chosen paths are stored in the wizard config and propagated to:
  - `inventories/<codename>/group_vars/all/vars.yml`
  - `~/vedicon.config/<codename>-<scenario>/sourced_vedicon.sh`
  - SSH config templates, vault paths, devkit scripts

### Step 2 - Choose new or existing

What you see at this step depends on whether you've already deployed vedicon on this machine.

**First-time setup** — no previous configuration is detected, the wizard goes straight to "new":

![Step 2 - first-time setup](docs/img/step-02-new-01.png)

**Subsequent runs** — at least one previous configuration exists, the wizard offers a choice:

![Step 2 - new or existing](docs/img/step-02-new-or-existing-01.png)

**What you do:** first-time setup → nothing to pick, just continue. If you already deployed a config, you'll see it listed and can either start a new one or overwrite an existing one.

**Behind the scenes:**
- Scans `inventories/` for existing setups (folders with `hosts.yml`)
- For each, parses `group_vars/` to detect deployed scenarios
- Shows one button per `codename + scenario` combination, plus `◆ new`

If you pick "new", an empty inventory will be created. If you pick an existing one, the wizard pre-fills all fields from `group_vars/all/vars.yml`.

### Step 3 - Enter your infrastructure codename

![Step 3 - codename](docs/img/step-03-codename.png)

**What you do:** pick a label for your Proxmox infrastructure (e.g., `mylab`).
This becomes the namespace for everything related to this Proxmox.

**Behind the scenes:**
- Will create `inventories/<codename>/` from `inventories/example/` template
- All subsequent files (vault, SSH keys, workspace) are scoped under this codename

### Step 4 - Proxmox connection details

![Step 4 - Proxmox address + node](docs/img/step-04-proxmox.png)

**What you do:**
- **Address**: IP or hostname of your Proxmox (e.g., `192.168.1.10`)
- **Node**: Proxmox node name (see below)

#### The PVE node name must be exact

The wizard asks for the **Proxmox node name**. This is **not** a label you choose - it must match exactly the node name as it appears in the Proxmox web UI / API. Often it's `pve` on a single-node setup, but it can also be `pve01`, the hostname, or anything the cluster admin set.

![Step 4 - PVE strict node name](docs/img/step-04-pve-strict-name.png)

You can find the exact name in the Proxmox web console (left sidebar tree, the entry under "Datacenter") or via SSH on the Proxmox host: `pvesh get /nodes --output-format json | jq -r '.[].node'`.

If the name doesn't match exactly, the wizard's API calls will fail at Step 4 validation (or later at deploy time on `vm_create`).

**Behind the scenes:**
- Tests HTTPS reachability to `https://<address>:8006`
- Validates the node name exists in Proxmox API (`GET /nodes`)

No changes are made yet - this is read-only verification.

#### Proxmox root password

The wizard then prompts for the Proxmox **root password**.

![Step 4 - Proxmox root password](docs/img/step-04-root-password-proxmox.png)

**What it's used for:**
- Install the vedicon root SSH key in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` (one-shot, via `sshpass`)
- Create the `jump_user` Linux account on Proxmox
- Create the `vedicon_api` PAM user + API token via `pveum`
- Configure Proxmox locale, NTP, IP forwarding, network bridges (`vmbr140-148`), NAT rules

After this bootstrap, root SSH is no longer used — daily operations go through the `jump_user` and the API token (see [Why a `jump_user` and not just root?](#why-a-jump_user-and-not-just-root) below).

**Privacy note:** the password is held in memory by the wizard for the duration of the run and never written to disk.

#### Deployer-cli sudo password

The wizard also prompts for the **sudo password on the deployer-cli** (your local machine in the default setup).

![Step 4 - deployer-cli sudo password](docs/img/step-04-deployer-cli-sudo-password.png)

**What it's used for:**
- `apt install` packages required by the deployer-cli role (ansible, git, keychain, zsh, sshpass, etc.)
- Install dotfiles and configure system services (locale, NTP)
- Write SSH config under `~/.ssh/` (no sudo strictly needed for `~/.ssh`, but other steps in the role need it)

If the deployer-cli is your local machine (the default), this is your own sudo password. If you target a remote deployer-cli VM, this is the sudo password of the user on that VM.

### Step 5 - Network (NAT auto-detect + bridge toggles)

![Step 5 - NAT + bridges](docs/img/step-05-network.png)

**What you do:**
- The wizard auto-detects your outbound NAT interface (typically `vmbr0`)
- Bridges `vmbr140` to `vmbr148` are listed with a NAT toggle each
- Defaults are fine - accept

#### Disable outgoing NAT on a specific bridge

If you want to **isolate one or several subnets from internet access**, just click on the corresponding bridge in the list to toggle off its outgoing NAT.

![Step 5 - outgoing NAT toggle](docs/img/step-05-outgoing-nat.png)

This is useful for fully air-gapped subnets (e.g., a sensitive forensic VM, an offline analysis lab) — VMs on a NAT-disabled bridge can still talk to other VMs on the same subnet, but cannot reach the internet through the Proxmox host.

#### Why bridges are pre-created

By default, vedicon **pre-creates all the bridges listed in the wizard** (`vmbr140` to `vmbr148`) on the Proxmox host as part of this step, even if your scenario only uses a few of them.

**Why:** it saves time on later deployments. Once the bridges exist, deploying any scenario (or adding a new one with more subnets) requires no Proxmox network reconfiguration — the wizard just clones VMs onto the already-existing bridges. The cost is minimal: an unused bridge is just a Linux interface with no traffic.

**Behind the scenes:**
- SSH to Proxmox as root, runs `ip route get 1.1.1.1 | awk '{print $5}'`
- Identifies outbound interface (typically `vmbr0`)
- Creates the `vmbr140-148` bridges via `pvesh create /nodes/<node>/network` (idempotent — skipped if already present)
- Injects per-bridge NAT rules (post-up/post-down iptables MASQUERADE) for bridges with NAT enabled
- Reloads Proxmox network config (`ifreload -a`)
- Stores in inventory:
  - `infrastructure_proxmox_default_network_card_interface: vmbr0`
  - Per-bridge `nat: true/false` toggle

### Step 6 - Pick scenario

![Step 6 - scenario](docs/img/step-06-scenario.png)

**What you do:** type `blank_scenario_2_subnets`.

**Behind the scenes:**
- Stored as `INFRASTRUCTURE_SCENARIO` in `group_vars/all/vars.yml`
- Determines which J2 templates the deploy will use

### Step 7 - Deployer + auto-deploy

This step asks **where** the deployer-cli will run (location + user) and then launches the full deployment. The two passwords (Proxmox root + deployer-cli sudo) were already collected at [Step 4](#step-4---proxmox-connection-details).

#### Deployer-cli location (IP)

![Step 7 - deployer-cli location](docs/img/step-07-location.png)

**What you do:** enter the IP / hostname where the deployer-cli will be configured.

**By default, vedicon deploys the deployer-cli on the same machine where you run the wizard** — so the default value is `127.0.0.1`. Most users keep this.

If you want a dedicated deployer-cli VM (e.g., to manage multiple Proxmox infrastructures from one place, or to keep credentials off your laptop), enter that VM's IP instead. The VM must already exist and be reachable over SSH.

#### Deployer-cli user

![Step 7 - deployer-cli user](docs/img/step-07-deployer-user.png)

**What you do:** enter the Linux user that will own the workspace on the deployer-cli.

If you kept `127.0.0.1` above, this is your current local user (typically what `whoami` returns). On a dedicated deployer-cli VM, this is the user that will hold `~/vedicon/`, `~/vedicon.config/`, `~/.ssh/vedicon/`, etc.

The user must:
- Already exist on the deployer-cli machine
- Have sudo rights (for the apt installs in Playbook 03)
- Be reachable over SSH from the wizard machine (only if you target a remote deployer-cli)

#### Confirm and trigger the deployer-cli install

This is the **last interactive prompt** — the wizard shows a recap of everything it's about to do (Proxmox address, codename, scenario, deployer-cli location/user, network bridges) and asks you to confirm before any change is made on Proxmox or on the deployer-cli.

![Step 8 - confirm deployer-cli install](docs/img/step-08-deployer-cli-install.png)

**What you do:** review the recap, then confirm to launch the install.

**Why a confirmation step:** up to here the wizard has only been **collecting input and doing read-only checks** (HTTPS reachability, node name validation). The moment you confirm, the wizard starts making real changes — installing SSH keys on Proxmox, creating the jump_user, generating the API token, writing the vault, configuring the deployer-cli. This is your last opportunity to abort cleanly.

If you abort here (Ctrl-C or "Cancel"), nothing has been touched on Proxmox or on the deployer-cli yet — your input is just discarded.

#### Auto-deploy starts

After confirming, the wizard runs the full deployment automatically (~10-15 min).

**Behind the scenes:** the wizard runs `ansible-playbook site.yml` which executes 3 vedicon_playbook in sequence.

#### Playbook 01 - credentials.generate

**Local actions:**
- Generate 4 SSH keypairs (ed25519) in `config/<codename>-<scenario>/ssh_keys/`:
  - `px.<codename>-<scenario>-ssh_cli.root` - Proxmox root SSH
  - `px.<codename>-<scenario>-ssh_cli.jump_user` - Proxmox jump user SSH
  - `r42.<codename>-<scenario>-deployer-key_alice` - admin user on VMs
  - `r42.<codename>-<scenario>-student-key_bob` - student user on VMs
- Generate vault with random VM passwords + Wazuh password
- Encrypt vault with `vault_pass.txt`
- Generate operator's SSH config snippet

#### Playbook 02 - configure proxmox

**Proxmox actions (via root SSH using password from wizard):**
- Install the root SSH key in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- Create `jump_user` Linux user
- Install Linux locale (en_US.UTF-8)
- Configure NTP

**Proxmox actions (via API token, then via root SSH):**
- Create `vedicon_api` PAM user
- Generate `vedicon_api_token` token (auto-recovers if exists with wrong secret)
- Inject token secret into vault
- Create bridges `vmbr140` to `vmbr148` via `pvesh`
- Inject NAT rules per bridge (post-up/post-down iptables MASQUERADE)
- Reload Proxmox network (`ifreload -a`)
- Enable IP forwarding

##### Why a `jump_user` and not just root?

You'll notice vedicon creates a separate `jump_user` Linux account on Proxmox,
even though it already installed the root SSH key. Two reasons:

1. **Separation of concerns.** Root is used **only once** during bootstrap
   (install the root key, create the jump user, set the API token). After that,
   day-to-day operations (`vedicon-context use`, `ssh r42.<vm>`) use the API token
   and `jump_user`. Root SSH is no longer needed.

2. **Reduced attack surface for ProxyJump.** A SSH connection through a `jump_user`
   only needs to forward TCP to the internal subnets - it doesn't need a shell.
   Even if the jump key leaks, the attacker has no shell on Proxmox (you can lock
   the user down further with `ForceCommand` or restricted shell if desired).

   Honestly, this doesn't add a huge amount of security on its own - the `jump_user`
   on Proxmox is still a Linux account. But it's a good hygiene practice and lets
   you rotate the jump key without touching root.

#### Playbook 03 - deploy deployer-cli

**Deployer-cli actions (via SSH from your local machine):**
- Install packages: `ansible`, `git`, `keychain`, `oh-my-zsh`, `zsh`, `vim`, etc.
- Configure NTP and locale
- Install dotfiles (vim, zsh)
- Clone all 5 vedicon repos to `~/vedicon/` (see table below)
- Create workspace at `~/vedicon.config/<codename>-<scenario>/`
- Upload SSH keys + vault from local machine
- Create symlinks: `scenario →` (in workspace), `secrets →` (in playbook scenario dir)
- Generate two SSH config files from J2 templates:
  - `~/.ssh/config` - adds `Include` for the next file
  - `~/.ssh/config_vedicon-<codename>-<scenario>` - actual host entries
- Inject `source ~/vedicon.config/vedicon-context.sh` into `.zshrc`
- Set the active context to this codename + scenario

After this, `vedicon-context use <codename> <scenario>` works.

##### The 5 repos cloned on the deployer-cli

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `vedicon` | Main repo. Wizard, 11 Ansible roles, 3 vedicon_playbook, the `vedicon-context` shell tool. |
| `vedicon-vedicon_playbook` | Lab scenarios (demo_lab, blank_scenario_*). What gets deployed on the Proxmox VMs. |
| `vedicon-catalog` | Reusable Ansible roles (firewalls, packages, dotfiles, wazuh, etc.) used by scenarios. |
| `vedicon-ansible_roles-proxmox_controller` | Wraps the Proxmox API (create/clone/delete VMs, manage templates, networks). |
| `vedicon-ansible_roles-debug-devkit` | Helper scripts for snapshots, reverts, debugging individual VMs. |

### Step 8 - Deploy the scenario itself

This isn't a wizard step - you run it manually after the wizard finishes.

#### 8a. Load your context

Open a new terminal (or `source ~/.zshrc` in the current one), then load the workspace you just created:

```bash
vedicon-context use YOUR_CODENAME_INFRASTRUCTURE blank_scenario_2_subnets
```

You should see `vedicon-context` switch into the workspace, with output like this:

```

```

If every line of the status block ends with `ok`, the workspace is loaded correctly and you're ready to deploy. If anything is `ko`, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

#### 8b. Deploy the scenario VMs

```bash
vedicon-context deploy    # ~15-20 min for first deploy
```

**Behind the scenes:**

1. Downloads cloud-init images (Ubuntu Noble, Server, Debian 12) to Proxmox storage
2. Creates 9 VM templates (nano, micro, small, medium, large) on `vmbr140`
3. For each of 4 team VMs:
   - Clones template (small, vm_id 9221) to a new VM
   - Sets cloud-init variables (user, password, SSH key, IP, gateway, bridge)
   - Starts the VM
   - Waits for SSH and cloud-init completion
4. On all 4 VMs:
   - Installs basic packages (vim, htop, net-utils)
   - Installs dotfiles for `alice` user
   - Configures UFW firewall (port 22 only)

When deploy completes, SSH into a VM:

```bash
ssh r42.bs2-team-143-01
```

You're now `alice@bs2-team-143-01`. From here you can ping the other 3 VMs
(`192.168.143.201`, `192.168.144.200`, `192.168.144.201`) and reach the internet
(NAT routes through `vmbr0`).

> **Note:** vedicon generated **both** the Ansible inventory and your `~/.ssh/config`
> for you. SSH keys are loaded automatically when you run `vedicon-context use`.
> No manual SSH key import or `-i keyfile` flag needed - just `ssh r42.<vm-name>`.

## What you can do after deploy

### Using vedicon-context

`vedicon-context` is the daily-use tool. It manages workspaces, switches between
infrastructures and scenarios, deploys/cleans up VMs, and reloads SSH keys.

It's a **shell function** (zsh), sourced from `~/.zshrc`. So `vedicon-context use`
modifies the current shell - no need to restart, no need to spawn subshells.

#### List configured contexts

> Lists all configured contexts (workspaces) on this deployer-cli, with the active one marked.

A workspace is a `codename + scenario` combination. After step 7 above, you have one.
After multiple `vedicon-context init` runs, you have several.

```
$ vedicon-context list

  ── available workspaces ──────────────────────────────────────
  ● [1]  mylab-blank_scenario_2_subnets       vedicon-context use mylab blank_scenario_2_subnets
  ○ [2]  mylab-demo_lab                       vedicon-context use mylab demo_lab
  ○ [3]  otherlab-blank_scenario_4_subnets    vedicon-context use otherlab blank_scenario_4_subnets
```

The active workspace is marked `●`. Inactive workspaces are `○`. The right
column shows the exact command to switch to that workspace.

#### Use a configured context

> Switches your shell to a configured context. SSH config, vault password,
> environment variables and prompt are all updated.

```
$ vedicon-context use mylab demo_lab

  ── switching context ────────────────────────────────────────
   ✓  workspace        : mylab-demo_lab
   ✓  vault password   : ~/vedicon.config/mylab-demo_lab/secrets/vault_pass.txt
   ✓  ssh keys loaded  : 4 keys
   ✓  ssh include      : ~/.ssh/config_vedicon-mylab-demo_lab
   ✓  prompt updated   : [mylab/demo_lab]
```

After this, all `vedicon-context` commands operate on the new workspace.

#### Show the current context

> Shows which context is currently active in your shell.

```
$ vedicon-context current
mylab-demo_lab
```

#### Inventory

Lists all hosts the active workspace will deploy:

```
$ vedicon-context show-inventory

@all:
  |--@vedicon_infrastructure:
  |  |--@r42_admin:
  |  |  |--r42.admin-wazuh
  |  |  |--r42.admin-deployer-api-gateway
  |  |  |--r42.admin-deployer-api-backend
  |  |  |--r42.admin-deployer-ui
  |  |--@r42_admin_wazuh_clients:
  |  |  |--r42.admin-deployer-api-gateway
  |  |  |--r42.admin-deployer-api-backend
  |  |  |--r42.admin-deployer-ui
  |  |--@r42_vuln_box_group:
  |  |  |--r42.vuln-box-00
  |  |  |--r42.vuln-box-01
  |  |  |--r42.vuln-box-02
  |  |  |--r42.vuln-box-03
  |  |  |--r42.vuln-box-04
  |  |--@proxmox:
  |  |  |--mylab
  |  |--@proxmox_cli:
  |  |  |--mylab-cli
```

Useful for sanity-checking what would be deployed before running `deploy`.

#### Try a single catalog element

For fast iteration on a single deployable element (Docker compose / Makefile)
from [vedicon-catalog](https://github.com/vedicon/vedicon_cyber_range_platform-catalog) without
rebuilding a full lab, vedicon ships a disposable-VM mode :

```bash
vedicon-context catalog-try-list                # browse available elements
vedicon-context catalog-try docker/_ctf/hello   # deploy + smoke-check one
```

`catalog-try` resolves the logical path, deploys the element on the
`catalog_try` VM, runs it, and smoke-checks it per the element's contract
(`catalog_try.yml` declaring L2 service / oneshot / L1 fallback). Each run
destroys + recreates the test VM, so iteration is fast and stateless. Admin
elements (Gitea, Mattermost, Nextcloud ...) are listed separately via
`catalog-try-list-admin`.

You can also bootstrap a fresh deployer-cli directly into this mode from your
laptop :

```bash
./vedicon-init.py --catalog-try docker/_ctf/hello
```

The wizard skips the scenario picker, forces `scenario=catalog_try`, and the
final banner suggests the right `vedicon-context catalog-try <path>` to run.

#### SSH into deployed VMs

`vedicon-context use` configures **two** things at once:
- Ansible inventory (for `vedicon-context deploy`)
- SSH config (for `ssh <hostname>` directly)

So once a workspace is active, you can SSH into any deployed VM by name:

```
$ ssh r42.bs2-team-143-01
alice@bs2-team-143-01:~$

$ ssh r42.admin-wazuh
alice@admin-wazuh:~$
```

The hostnames are defined in the auto-generated SSH config:
`~/.ssh/config_vedicon-<codename>-<scenario>` (included from `~/.ssh/config`).

VMs are on isolated bridges (vmbr143, vmbr144, etc.) - your operator machine
has no direct route to them. SSH uses **ProxyJump** through the Proxmox host:

```
   ┌─────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────┐         ┌───────────────────────┐
   │  your machine   │  ssh    │  Proxmox             │  ssh    │  bs2-team-143-01      │
   │  (operator)     │ ──────▶ │  user: jump_user     │ ──────▶ │  user: alice          │
   │                 │         │  on internet bridge  │         │  on internal vmbr143  │
   │  ssh key:       │         │                      │         │                       │
   │  jump_user key  │         │  (ProxyJump only,    │         │  ssh key:             │
   │  + alice key    │         │  no shell session)   │         │  alice key            │
   └─────────────────┘         └──────────────────────┘         └───────────────────────┘
```

Both keys are loaded into your ssh-agent by `vedicon-context use`. If they
disappear (after reboot), reload them:

```bash
vedicon-context ssh-reload
```

#### Initialise a new context

Use the wizard to add a new scenario or a new Proxmox infrastructure:

```bash
vedicon-context init
```

This launches `vedicon-init.py` again. From there you can:

- **Add a scenario to an existing codename** → pick the codename in step 2,
  then change the scenario in step 6 (e.g., switch from `blank_scenario_2_subnets`
  to `demo_lab`)
- **Add a new infrastructure (codename)** → pick "new" in step 2,
  enter a different codename in step 3

After init completes, the new workspace appears in `vedicon-context list`.

```
$ vedicon-context list

  ── available workspaces ──────────────────────────────────────
  ● [1]  mylab-blank_scenario_2_subnets       vedicon-context use mylab blank_scenario_2_subnets
  ○ [2]  mylab-demo_lab                       vedicon-context use mylab demo_lab    ← new
```

#### Overwrite an existing configuration

If you want to redo a configuration from scratch (wrong Proxmox address,
changed credentials, etc.) — re-run the wizard and pick the existing config
in step 2 instead of "new".

```bash
vedicon-context init
```

![Overwrite - existing config selection](docs/img/overwrite-01-existing.png)

In step 2, you'll see all your configured contexts listed below `◆ new`.
Pick the one you want to overwrite — the wizard will pre-fill all the fields
from the existing config, so you only need to update what changed.

> ⚠️ Overwriting a configuration **does not destroy deployed VMs**. It only
> regenerates the local files (inventory, vault, SSH keys). If you also want
> to clean up the running VMs, run `vedicon-context delete` afterwards (or
> before, if the existing keys won't work anymore).

You can also use this flow to:
- Update the Proxmox API address after migrating the host
- Re-generate SSH keys / vault if they got corrupted
- Tweak which bridges have NAT enabled
- Change the deployer-cli IP / user

#### Deploy / undeploy

```bash
vedicon-context deploy        # full deploy (templates + VMs + software)
vedicon-context deploy-vms    # fast redeploy (skip templates)
vedicon-context delete        # destroy everything + clean SSH known_hosts
vedicon-context delete-vms    # destroy VMs only (keep templates)
```

#### Reload SSH keys

If your ssh-agent loses keys (after reboot, etc.):

```bash
vedicon-context ssh-reload
```

#### Full command list

```
$ vedicon-context

  ── vedicon-context ──────────────────────────────────────────
   use <codename> <scenario>      switch active workspace
   list                           list available workspaces
   current                        show active workspace
   status                         show context details
   inventory                      show ansible inventory
   ssh-reload                     reload SSH keys into ssh-agent
   deploy                         deploy scenario VMs
   deploy-vms                     deploy VMs only (skip templates)
   delete                         destroy all VMs and templates
   delete-vms                     destroy VMs only (keep templates)
   init                           launch wizard to add scenario/infra
   debug                          toggle verbose ansible output
```

### Where credentials live

vedicon generates a lot of secrets at deploy time: SSH keys (4 of them), VM
passwords, the Wazuh password, the Proxmox API token. They all live under
your workspace, encrypted in an Ansible vault.

#### Workspace layout

```
~/vedicon.config/<codename>-<scenario>/
├── secrets/
│   ├── default_vault.yml          ← encrypted vault (passwords, API token, etc.)
│   ├── vault_pass.txt             ← password to decrypt the vault (chmod 600)
│   ├── vault.view.sh              ← helper: view vault contents
│   ├── vault.edit.sh              ← helper: edit vault
│   ├── vault.create.sh            ← helper: create new vault
│   └── vault.changepwd.sh         ← helper: change vault password
├── ssh_keys/
│   ├── jump_keys/
│   │   ├── px.<codename>-<scenario>-ssh_cli.root         ← Proxmox root SSH key
│   │   └── px.<codename>-<scenario>-ssh_cli.jump_user    ← Proxmox jump user key
│   ├── backend_keys/
│   │   └── r42.<codename>-<scenario>-deployer-key_alice  ← admin user on VMs
│   └── student_keys/
│       └── r42.<codename>-<scenario>-student-key_bob     ← student user on VMs
├── inventory/
│   └── inventory_default.yml      ← ansible inventory (hosts + groups)
├── sourced_vedicon.sh             ← env vars sourced by vedicon-context use
└── scenario → ../../vedicon/vedicon-vedicon_playbook/scenarios/<scenario>/   ← symlink
```

#### Where is the vault password

It's in the workspace, in plain text:

```
~/vedicon.config/<codename>-<scenario>/secrets/vault_pass.txt
```

This file has `chmod 600` and is owned by your user. It exists by design -
this is what allows `vedicon-context deploy` to run without prompting for the
vault password every time.

> ⚠️ This means **anyone with read access to your home directory can decrypt
> the vault**. Don't share `~/vedicon.config/` or back it up to insecure storage.

#### How to view the vault contents

The vault contains generated VM passwords, the Wazuh password, the Proxmox API
token, and the SSH key passphrases (`ssh_passphrase_px_root`,
`ssh_passphrase_px_jump`, `ssh_passphrase_admin_alice`,
`ssh_passphrase_student_bob`, plus one per student extra key). To inspect them
with the active workspace loaded:

```bash
vedicon-context show-vault
```

This wraps `ansible-vault view` against the active workspace's
`default_vault.yml` and uses `vault_pass.txt` automatically.

If you prefer working from the workspace directory directly, the helper
scripts shipped in the workspace still work:

```bash
cd ~/vedicon.config/<codename>-<scenario>/secrets/
./vault.view.sh default_vault.yml
```

To edit:

```bash
./vault.edit.sh default_vault.yml
```

Opens the vault in `$EDITOR`, encrypts on save.

#### I lost my Proxmox root password

Run `cat default_vault.yml.example` is not it - the example is a template.

If you generated passwords during the wizard, the actual password is **inside
the vault**. View it:

```bash
./vault.view.sh default_vault.yml | grep -i password
```

If the wizard didn't generate it (you provided your own), it's not stored
anywhere by vedicon - only the SSH root key was installed on Proxmox.

#### I lost my SSH keys for the VMs

The keys live in `~/vedicon.config/<codename>-<scenario>/ssh_keys/`. As long as
you have this directory, you have everything.

If `vedicon-context use` complains about missing keys, run:

```bash
vedicon-context ssh-reload
```

If the keys themselves are physically deleted, the simplest recovery is to
redeploy:

```bash
vedicon-context delete
vedicon-context deploy   # regenerates SSH keys + vault, recreates Proxmox config
```

This is destructive - your VMs will be recreated from scratch.

#### I want to back up everything

Use `vedicon-workspace export`:

```bash
vedicon-workspace export <codename> <scenario>
# → <codename>-<scenario>.r42.tar.gz  (includes secrets, ssh_keys, inventory)
```

Store this tarball somewhere safe (encrypted disk, password manager attachment,
etc.). To restore on another machine:

```bash
vedicon-workspace import <codename>-<scenario>.r42.tar.gz
vedicon-context use <codename> <scenario>
```

---

## Updating vedicon

vedicon lives in 5 git repos. To update everything to latest:

```bash
vedicon-context init     # easiest - the wizard pulls all 5 repos before showing the menu
```

Or manually:

```bash
for repo in vedicon vedicon-vedicon_playbook vedicon-catalog \
            vedicon-ansible_roles-proxmox_controller \
            vedicon-ansible_roles-debug-devkit; do
  echo "=== $repo ==="
  cd ~/vedicon/$repo && git pull
done
```

After updating, you may want to redeploy to apply role/playbook changes:

```bash
vedicon-context delete-vms      # keeps templates
vedicon-context deploy-vms      # redeploy with new code (~5 min)
```

If a role under `~/vedicon/vedicon/roles/` changed (e.g., `deployer.bootstrap`),
run the full `site.yml` again via `vedicon-context init` to rebuild the
deployer-cli config.

---

## Troubleshooting

### The fast way - use vedicon-context

Most issues with stale state (failed deploy, partial cleanup, IP/key conflicts)
can be fixed by tearing down and redeploying. After `vedicon-context use <codename> <scenario>`:

```bash
# full reset (deletes templates + VMs + SSH known_hosts, then redeploys)
vedicon-context delete
vedicon-context deploy

# faster reset (keeps templates, recreates VMs only)
vedicon-context delete-vms
vedicon-context deploy-vms
```

This handles 90% of issues automatically - start here before deep-diving.

### What's happening behind the scenes

If you want to understand what's actually breaking before running `delete`:

**Wizard fails on preflight**
Missing local dependencies. Install the apt packages shown by the wizard.
The wizard checks: `ansible`, `ssh-keygen`, `ssh-agent`, `sshpass`, `git`, `keychain`, `zsh`,
plus Ansible collections `community.crypto` and `community.general`.

**Proxmox check fails**
The wizard couldn't reach `https://<address>:8006`. Verify manually with
`curl -k https://<address>:8006`. Common causes: wrong IP, firewall, Proxmox not running.

**Deploy fails on `vm_create` "already exists"**
Templates (vm_id 9211-9248) exist from a previous deploy. The proxmox controller
auto-skips them - just re-run. If the failure persists, run `vedicon-context delete`
to remove leftover state.

**SSH "REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED"**
The IP was previously used by a different VM with a different SSH host key.
The `delete` and `delete-vms` commands handle this by running:

```bash
~/vedicon/vedicon-vedicon_playbook/scenarios/blank_scenario_2_subnets/blank_scenario_2_subnets.reset.ssh_keys.sh
```

You can run this script directly if you only want to reset known_hosts without redeploying.

**Deploy fails on `chattr` errors during SSH key generation**
Already fixed in current version. Pull latest from vedicon repo. The fix removes
`attributes: ""` from `openssh_keypair` which was failing on virtio/qcow2 disks.

**Vault corrupted or unable to decrypt**
The simplest recovery is to redeploy the VMs (the vault itself is regenerated
during deploy, and the SSH keys it references are also regenerated):

```bash
vedicon-context delete-vms
vedicon-context deploy-vms
```

This keeps the Proxmox templates (no need to re-download cloud images) but
recreates everything else, including a fresh vault.

If the vault is intact but you can't view it, check `vault_pass.txt` exists in
the same `secrets/` directory and is readable.

**Wazuh / admin VMs**
This guide deploys `blank_scenario_2_subnets` which **supports** the admin
infrastructure (wazuh server + deployer platform on `vmbr142`). It's currently
**disabled by default** because not fully tested. To enable, edit
`scenarios/blank_scenario_2_subnets/main.yml` and uncomment the
`01_admin_infrastructure/_main.yml` import (and the related blocks in that file).

---

## Project structure

The `vedicon` repo (the one you cloned in step 0) is laid out as follows:

```
vedicon/
├── vedicon-init.py           — setup wizard (Python/Textual TUI)
├── ansible.cfg
├── site.yml                  — runs all 3 vedicon_playbook in sequence
├── vedicon_playbook/
│   ├── 01_generate_credentials.yml
│   ├── 02_configure_proxmox.yml
│   └── 03_deploy_deployer_cli.yml
├── inventories/
│   └── example/              — copy and customize for your infra
├── roles/                    — 11 modular roles
└── config/                   — generated credentials (not committed)
```

The other 4 repos (`vedicon-vedicon_playbook`, `vedicon-catalog`,
`vedicon-ansible_roles-proxmox_controller`, `vedicon-ansible_roles-debug-devkit`)
are cloned by the wizard onto the deployer-cli during the deploy. You don't
need them on your operator machine.

---

## Manual setup (advanced)

The wizard (`python3 vedicon-init.py`, covered in the [Walkthrough](#walkthrough---wizard-steps)
above) is the recommended path. The manual flow below exists for users who want
to script the setup, integrate it in their own tooling, or simply understand
exactly what gets executed.

It runs the same 3 vedicon_playbook the wizard runs, in the same order, against an
inventory you write by hand from the `inventories/example/` template.

```bash
# 1. Copy the template inventory
cp -r inventories/example inventories/my-infra

# 2. Edit the 3 files below with your settings:
#    - inventories/my-infra/hosts.yml                            (Proxmox + deployer-cli connection)
#    - inventories/my-infra/group_vars/all/vars.yml              (infrastructure settings)
#    - inventories/my-infra/group_vars/demo_lab/vars.yml         (scenario settings)

# 3. Generate credentials (SSH keys, vault, passwords) - runs locally
ansible-playbook vedicon_playbook/01_generate_credentials.yml \
  -i inventories/my-infra/hosts.yml \
  -e @inventories/my-infra/group_vars/demo_lab/vars.yml \
  -e INFRASTRUCTURE_SCENARIO=demo_lab

# 4. Configure Proxmox (root key install, jump_user, API token, bridges, NAT)
ansible-playbook vedicon_playbook/02_configure_proxmox.yml \
  -i inventories/my-infra/hosts.yml \
  -e @inventories/my-infra/group_vars/demo_lab/vars.yml \
  -e INFRASTRUCTURE_SCENARIO=demo_lab

# 5. Deploy the deployer-cli (packages, repos, workspace, SSH config, vedicon-context)
ansible-playbook vedicon_playbook/03_deploy_deployer_cli.yml \
  -i inventories/my-infra/hosts.yml \
  -e @inventories/my-infra/group_vars/demo_lab/vars.yml \
  -e INFRASTRUCTURE_SCENARIO=demo_lab \
  --vault-password-file ./config/my-infra-demo_lab/secrets/vault_pass.txt

# 6. On the deployer-cli, use the workspace
vedicon-context use my-infra demo_lab
vedicon-context status
vedicon-context deploy
```

Note on `-e @...vars.yml`: this loads the scenario's group_vars as extra vars.
Without it, Ansible silently ignores `inventories/<cn>/group_vars/<scenario>/vars.yml`
because no inventory group matches the scenario name, and role defaults would win.

Or run all three at once via `site.yml`:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml \
  -i inventories/my-infra/hosts.yml \
  -e @inventories/my-infra/group_vars/demo_lab/vars.yml \
  -e INFRASTRUCTURE_SCENARIO=demo_lab \
  --vault-password-file ./config/my-infra-demo_lab/secrets/vault_pass.txt
```

---

## Extend the scenarios

All deployable scenarios live in [vedicon-vedicon_playbook/scenarios](https://github.com/vedicon/vedicon_cyber_range_platform-vedicon_playbook/tree/main/scenarios) - the list will grow over time.

The reusable building blocks (CVEs, misconfigured services, product setups, Ansible roles) live in the [vedicon-catalog](https://github.com/vedicon/vedicon_cyber_range_platform-catalog) repository.

**Want a specific product, CVE or misconfiguration added?** Open an issue on the [vedicon-catalog](https://github.com/vedicon/vedicon_cyber_range_platform-catalog/issues) repo - we centralise catalog requests there.

**Found a bug or have a feature request for vedicon itself?** Open an issue on the [vedicon](https://github.com/vedicon/vedicon_cyber_range_platform/issues) repo (anything not related to the catalog goes here).

We'll prioritise as fast as we can.
